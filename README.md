# Data Visualization - HR Dashboard Project

This project consists of two interactive dashboards designed to deliver comprehensive data visualization and analysis. The first, HR Summary Dashboard, focuses on high-level insights (Part 1), while the second, HR Details Dashboard, provides detailed employee records for in-depth analysis (Part 2).

Developed using Tableau, the dashboards are structured around detailed user stories that define key requirements and functionalities. The objective is to support stakeholders including HR managers and executives, in making informed, data-driven decisions by offering clear insights. They also help analyze human resources data by providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis.

## Summary View

The summary view should be divided into three main sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis.

### Overview

The Overview section should provide a snapshot of the overall HR metrics, including:

 - Display the total number of hired employees, active employees, and terminated employees.
 - Visualize the total number of hired and terminated employees over the years.
 - Present a breakdown of total employees by department and job titles.
 - Compare total employees between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ).
 - Show the distribution of employees by city and state.

### Demographics

The Demographics section should offer insights into the composition of the workforce, including:

 - Present the gender ratio in the company.
 - Visualize the distribution of employees across age groups and education levels.
 - Show the total number of employees within each age group.
 - Show the total number of employees within each education level.
 - Present the correlation between employees’s educational backgrounds and their performance ratings.

### Income

The income analysis section should focus on salary-related metrics, including:

 - Compare salaries across different education levels for both genders to identify any discrepancies or patterns.
 - Present how the age correlate with the salary for employees in each department.
